# Development Guide

## Version Control & Release Management

This project uses conventional commits and semantic versioning for automated releases.

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

#### Examples:
```bash
feat(api): add equipment status endpoint
fix(ui): resolve evidence panel rendering issue
docs: update API documentation
refactor(agents): improve error handling
```

### Making Commits

Use the interactive commit tool:
```bash
npm run commit
```

This will guide you through creating a properly formatted commit message.

### Release Process

Releases are automatically generated based on commit messages:

- `feat:` → Minor version bump
- `fix:` → Patch version bump
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` → Major version bump

### Manual Release

To create a release manually:
```bash
npm run release
```

### Changelog

The changelog is automatically generated from commit messages and can be found in `CHANGELOG.md`.
