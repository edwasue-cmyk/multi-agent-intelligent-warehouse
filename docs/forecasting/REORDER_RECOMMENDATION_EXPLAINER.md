# How Reorder Recommendations Work in Forecasting Dashboard

## Overview
**Yes, reorder recommendations are directly based on demand forecasting results!** The system uses forecasted demand to calculate optimal reorder quantities and urgency levels.

---

## Complete Flow

### Step 1: Identify Low Stock Items
**Location:** `src/api/routers/advanced_forecasting.py:197-204`

```python
# Get current inventory levels
inventory_query = """
SELECT sku, name, quantity, reorder_point, location
FROM inventory_items
WHERE quantity <= reorder_point * 1.5
ORDER BY quantity ASC
"""
```

The system identifies items that are at or near their reorder point (within 150% of reorder point).

### Step 2: Get Demand Forecast for Each SKU
**Location:** `src/api/routers/advanced_forecasting.py:213-218`

For each low-stock item, the system:
1. Calls `get_real_time_forecast(sku, 30)` - Gets 30-day forecast
2. Extracts `recent_average_demand` from the forecast
3. Uses this as the **expected daily demand** for calculations

```python
# Get recent demand forecast
try:
    forecast = await self.get_real_time_forecast(sku, 30)
    avg_daily_demand = forecast['recent_average_demand']
except:
    avg_daily_demand = 10  # Default fallback
```

**Key Point:** The `recent_average_demand` comes from the ML forecasting models (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.) that analyze historical patterns and predict future demand.

### Step 3: Calculate Recommended Order Quantity
**Location:** `src/api/routers/advanced_forecasting.py:220-223`

```python
# Calculate recommended order quantity
safety_stock = max(reorder_point, avg_daily_demand * 7)  # 7 days safety stock
recommended_quantity = int(safety_stock * 2) - current_stock
recommended_quantity = max(0, recommended_quantity)
```

**Formula Breakdown:**
- **Safety Stock** = max(reorder_point, forecasted_daily_demand × 7 days)
- **Recommended Quantity** = (Safety Stock × 2) - Current Stock
- Ensures enough inventory for 14 days of forecasted demand

### Step 4: Determine Urgency Level
**Location:** `src/api/routers/advanced_forecasting.py:225-239`

The urgency is calculated based on **days until stockout**:

```python
days_remaining = current_stock / max(avg_daily_demand, 1)

if days_remaining <= 3:
    urgency = "CRITICAL"  # Stock will run out in 3 days or less
elif days_remaining <= 7:
    urgency = "HIGH"      # Stock will run out within a week
elif days_remaining <= 14:
    urgency = "MEDIUM"    # Stock will run out within 2 weeks
else:
    urgency = "LOW"       # Stock levels are adequate
```

**Key Calculation:** `days_remaining = current_stock ÷ forecasted_daily_demand`

This directly uses the forecast to predict when stockout will occur!

### Step 5: Calculate Confidence Score
**Location:** `src/api/routers/advanced_forecasting.py:241-242`

```python
confidence_score = min(0.95, max(0.5, 1.0 - (days_remaining / 30)))
```

Confidence increases as urgency increases (more urgent = higher confidence in the recommendation).

## Where Forecast Data Comes From

The `get_real_time_forecast()` method:
1. Checks Redis cache for recent forecasts
2. If not cached, loads forecast from `all_sku_forecasts.json`
3. Returns forecast data including:
   - `recent_average_demand` - Used for reorder calculations
   - `predictions` - 30-day forecast
   - `confidence_intervals` - Model confidence
   - `best_model` - Which ML model performed best

**Forecast Source:** ML models trained on historical demand data:
- XGBoost
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- SVR (Support Vector Regression)

## How It Appears in the UI

**Location:** `ui/web/src/pages/Forecasting.tsx:429-476`

The forecasting dashboard displays reorder recommendations in a table showing:
- **SKU** - Item identifier
- **Current Stock** - Current inventory level
- **Recommended Order** - Calculated quantity to order
- **Urgency** - CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW (color-coded chips)
- **Reason** - Explanation (e.g., "Stock will run out in 3 days or less")
- **Confidence** - Percentage confidence score

## Summary

Reorder recommendations are entirely based on demand forecasting results.

The system performs the following operations:

1. Uses ML models to predict daily demand
2. Calculates how many days of stock remain based on forecast
3. Determines urgency from predicted stockout date
4. Calculates optimal order quantity using forecasted demand
5. Provides confidence scores based on forecast reliability

Without the forecasting system, reorder recommendations would only use static `reorder_point` values. With forecasting, the system:

- Adapts to changing demand patterns
- Predicts stockout dates accurately
- Optimizes order quantities based on forecasted needs
- Prioritizes urgent items based on forecasted demand velocity

This makes the reorder system intelligent and proactive rather than reactive.
