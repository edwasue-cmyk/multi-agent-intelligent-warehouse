# Deployment Documentation Analysis

## File Comparison

### `docs/deployment/README.md` (Quick Start Guide)
**Status:** ✅ **100% ACCURATE** - Tested and verified

**Strengths:**
- Correct script paths (`scripts/setup/setup_environment.sh`, `scripts/start_server.sh`)
- Accurate health endpoint (`/api/v1/health`)
- Correct frontend path (`src/ui/web`)
- Accurate database credentials and ports
- Tested troubleshooting section
- Correct migration file paths

**Purpose:** Quick start for local development

---

### Root `DEPLOYMENT.md` (Comprehensive Guide)
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS UPDATES** - Has outdated references but valuable production content

**Issues Found:**
1. ❌ Line 37: `./scripts/dev_up.sh` → Should be `./scripts/setup/dev_up.sh`
2. ❌ Line 43: `./RUN_LOCAL.sh` → Should be `./scripts/start_server.sh` (file doesn't exist)
3. ❌ Line 48: `cd ui/web` → Should be `cd src/ui/web`
4. ❌ Line 386: `python src/api/cli/migrate.py up` → File doesn't exist
5. ❌ Line 389: `python scripts/simple_migrate.py` → File doesn't exist
6. ⚠️ Some environment variable defaults may need verification

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive production deployment guide
- Docker deployment instructions
- Kubernetes/Helm deployment details
- Monitoring setup (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Security configuration (SSL/TLS, firewall)
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Scaling strategies
- Maintenance procedures

**Purpose:** Comprehensive deployment guide for all environments

## Recommendations

### Keep Both Files (Complementary Approach)

1. **`docs/deployment/README.md`** - Keep as-is
   - Quick start for local development
   - 100% accurate and tested
   - Reference from root DEPLOYMENT.md

2. **Root `DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Update and fix
   - Fix all outdated script paths
   - Remove references to non-existent files
   - Keep all production deployment sections
   - Add reference to `docs/deployment/README.md` for quick start
   - Update environment variable defaults
