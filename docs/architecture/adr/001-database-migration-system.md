# ADR-001: Database Migration System

## Status

**Accepted** - 2024-01-01

## Context

The Warehouse Operational Assistant requires a robust database schema management system to handle:

- Schema evolution across different environments (development, staging, production)
- Version control for database changes
- Safe deployment of schema updates
- Rollback capabilities for failed migrations
- Dependency management between migrations
- Audit trail of all database changes

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive database migration system with the following characteristics:

### Core Components

1. **Migration Service** (`src/api/services/migration.py`)
   - Centralized migration management
   - Dependency resolution and execution order
   - Rollback support with validation
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **Migration CLI** (`src/api/cli/migrate.py`)
   - Command-line interface for migration operations
   - Status checking and health monitoring
   - Dry-run capabilities for testing

3. **Migration API** (`src/api/routers/migration.py`)
   - REST endpoints for programmatic migration control
   - Integration with monitoring and health checks

4. **Database Schema** (`data/postgres/migrations/`)
   - SQL migration files with versioning
   - Configuration and metadata files
   - Rollback scripts and documentation

### Key Features

- **Sequential Versioning**: 3-digit zero-padded version numbers (001, 002, 003, ...)
- **Dependency Management**: Migrations can depend on other migrations
- **Rollback Support**: Each migration can include rollback SQL
- **Safety Features**: Dry-run mode, transaction safety, timeout protection
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all migration operations
- **Health Monitoring**: Migration system health checks and status reporting

### Migration File Structure

```
data/postgres/migrations/
├── 001_initial_schema.sql
├── 002_warehouse_tables.sql
├── 003_timescale_hypertables.sql
└── migration_config.yaml
```

### Database Tables

- `schema_migrations`: Tracks applied migrations
- `application_metadata`: Application version and configuration
- `audit_log`: Audit trail for all database changes

## Rationale

### Why This Approach

1. **Version Control**: Sequential versioning provides clear ordering and prevents conflicts
2. **Dependency Management**: Ensures migrations run in correct order and validates dependencies
3. **Rollback Support**: Critical for production environments where rollbacks may be necessary
4. **Safety Features**: Dry-run mode and transaction safety prevent accidental data loss
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging for compliance and debugging
6. **CLI and API**: Both command-line and programmatic interfaces for different use cases

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Alembic (SQLAlchemy)**: 
   - Pros: Mature, widely used
   - Cons: Python-specific, complex for simple SQL migrations

2. **Flyway**:
   - Pros: Java-based, enterprise features
   - Cons: Additional dependency, not Python-native

3. **Custom Scripts**:
   - Pros: Simple, lightweight
   - Cons: No dependency management, no rollback support

4. **Database-specific tools**:
   - Pros: Native to database
   - Cons: Not portable, limited features

### Trade-offs

1. **Complexity vs. Features**: More complex than simple scripts, but provides enterprise-grade features
2. **Dependencies vs. Simplicity**: Adds dependencies but provides robust functionality
3. **Learning Curve vs. Long-term Benefits**: Initial learning curve but long-term maintenance benefits

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Reliable Schema Management**: Consistent schema across all environments
- **Safe Deployments**: Dry-run mode and rollback capabilities
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete audit trail for regulatory requirements
- **Developer Productivity**: CLI and API interfaces for easy migration management
- **Production Safety**: Transaction safety and error handling

### Negative

- **Initial Complexity**: More complex than simple migration scripts
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn migration system concepts
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Additional system to maintain and monitor

### Risks

- **Migration Failures**: Complex migrations could fail and require manual intervention
- **Rollback Complexity**: Some migrations may be difficult to rollback
- **Dependency Issues**: Circular dependencies could cause problems

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing in development and staging environments
2. **Documentation**: Clear documentation and examples for common scenarios
3. **Monitoring**: Health checks and monitoring for migration system
4. **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups before major migrations
5. **Gradual Rollout**: Phased deployment of migration system

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Migration System
- [x] Migration service implementation
- [x] CLI tool development
- [x] API endpoints
- [x] Database schema design

### Phase 2: Migration Files
- [x] Initial schema migration
- [x] Warehouse tables migration
- [x] TimescaleDB hypertables migration
- [x] Configuration files

### Phase 3: Testing and Documentation
- [x] Unit tests for migration service
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] Documentation and examples
- [x] CLI help and examples

### Phase 4: Production Deployment
- [ ] Production environment setup
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Team training and documentation

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics

- Migration execution time
- Migration success/failure rates
- Rollback frequency
- System health status

### Alerts

- Migration failures
- Migration timeouts
- Database connection issues
- Rollback failures

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Parallel Migrations**: Support for parallel migration execution
2. **Migration Templates**: Pre-built templates for common migration patterns
3. **Visual Interface**: Web-based migration management interface
4. **Advanced Rollback**: More sophisticated rollback strategies
5. **Performance Analytics**: Advanced performance monitoring and analytics

### Deprecation Strategy

If we need to replace this system in the future:

1. **Migration Path**: Create migration scripts to move to new system
2. **Data Preservation**: Ensure all migration history is preserved
3. **Gradual Transition**: Phased transition to new system
4. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to rollback to current system if needed
