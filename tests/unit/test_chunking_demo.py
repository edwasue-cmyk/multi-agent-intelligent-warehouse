    Forklift Safety Procedures and Equipment Maintenance Guidelines
    
    Before operating any forklift, operators must complete a comprehensive pre-operation inspection checklist.
    This includes checking the hydraulic system, brakes, steering mechanism, and load backrest for any signs of damage or wear.
    All operators must be properly certified and wear appropriate personal protective equipment including hard hats and safety shoes.
    
    When operating the forklift, maintain a safe speed appropriate for the working environment and always look in the direction of travel.
    Never exceed the rated capacity of the forklift and ensure all loads are properly secured before movement.
    Use the horn when approaching intersections and always yield the right of way to pedestrians.
    
    Regular maintenance is crucial for forklift safety and performance. Schedule preventive maintenance every 250 hours of operation or monthly, whichever comes first.
    This includes checking fluid levels, inspecting hydraulic hoses, testing brake systems, and verifying steering responsiveness.
    Keep detailed maintenance logs for all equipment including dates, services performed, and parts replaced.
    
    After operation, park the forklift in designated areas with the forks lowered and parking brake engaged.
    Report any mechanical issues immediately to the maintenance department and tag out equipment that requires repair.
    Follow all lockout/tagout procedures when performing maintenance or repairs.
    
    Training and certification are essential for safe forklift operation. All operators must complete initial training and pass a written and practical examination.
    Refresher training should be conducted annually or whenever there are changes in equipment or procedures.
    Supervisors should conduct regular safety observations and provide feedback to operators.
