- **Diversity scoring** to ensure varied source coverage and avoid bias
- **Relevance scoring** with configurable thresholds (0.35 minimum evidence score)
- **Source diversity validation** requiring minimum 2 distinct sources
- **Evidence scoring** for confidence assessment and quality control

#### **Smart Query Routing**
- **Automatic SQL vs Vector vs Hybrid routing** based on query characteristics
- **SQL path** for ATP/quantity/equipment status queries (structured data)
- **Vector path** for documentation, procedures, and knowledge queries

#### **Confidence & Quality Control**
- **Advanced Evidence Scoring** with multi-factor analysis:
  - Vector similarity scoring (30% weight)
  - Source authority and credibility assessment (25% weight)
  - Content freshness and recency evaluation (20% weight)
  - Cross-reference validation between sources (15% weight)
  - Source diversity scoring (10% weight)
- **Intelligent Confidence Assessment** with 0.35 threshold for high-quality responses
- **Source Diversity Validation** requiring minimum 2 distinct sources
- **Smart Clarifying Questions Engine** for low-confidence scenarios:
  - Context-aware question generation based on query type
  - Ambiguity type detection (equipment-specific, location-specific, time-specific, etc.)
  - Question prioritization (critical, high, medium, low)
  - Follow-up question suggestions
  - Validation rules for answer quality
- **Confidence Indicators** (high/medium/low) with evidence quality assessment
- **Intelligent Fallback** mechanisms for edge cases

## 🧑‍💻 Development Guide

### Run locally (API only)
```bash
./RUN_LOCAL.sh
# open http://localhost:<PORT>/docs
```

### Dev infrastructure
```bash
./scripts/dev_up.sh
# then (re)start API
./RUN_LOCAL.sh
```

### 3) Start the Frontend (Optional)
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd ui/web

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start the React development server
npm start
# Frontend will be available at http://localhost:3001
```

**Important**: Always run `npm start` from the `ui/web` directory, not from the project root!

### Troubleshooting
- **Port 8000/8001 busy**: the runner auto-increments; or export `PORT=8010`.
- **Postgres 5432 busy**: Timescale binds to **5435** by default here.
- **Compose v1 errors** (`ContainerConfig`): use the plugin (`docker compose`) if possible; otherwise run `docker-compose down --remove-orphans` then `up -d`.
- **Frontend "Cannot find module './App'"**: Make sure you're running `npm start` from the `ui/web` directory, not the project root.
- **Frontend compilation errors**: Clear cache with `rm -rf node_modules/.cache && rm -rf .eslintcache` then restart.
- **Frontend port 3000 busy**: The app automatically uses port 3001. If needed, set `PORT=3002 npm start`.
