## 🧑‍💻 Development Guide

### Run locally (API only)
```bash
./RUN_LOCAL.sh
# open http://localhost:<PORT>/docs
```

### Dev infrastructure
```bash
./scripts/dev_up.sh
# then (re)start API
./RUN_LOCAL.sh
```

### 3) Start the Frontend (Optional)
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd ui/web

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start the React development server
npm start
# Frontend will be available at http://localhost:3001
```

**Important**: Always run `npm start` from the `ui/web` directory, not from the project root!

### Troubleshooting
- **Port 8000/8001 busy**: the runner auto-increments; or export `PORT=8010`.
- **Postgres 5432 busy**: Timescale binds to **5435** by default here.
- **Compose v1 errors** (`ContainerConfig`): use the plugin (`docker compose`) if possible; otherwise run `docker-compose down --remove-orphans` then `up -d`.
- **Frontend "Cannot find module './App'"**: Make sure you're running `npm start` from the `ui/web` directory, not the project root.
- **Frontend compilation errors**: Clear cache with `rm -rf node_modules/.cache && rm -rf .eslintcache` then restart.
- **Frontend port 3000 busy**: The app automatically uses port 3001. If needed, set `PORT=3002 npm start`.
